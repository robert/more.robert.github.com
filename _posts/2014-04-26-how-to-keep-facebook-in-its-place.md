title: How to keep Facebook in its place
---
Facebook can be a good thing to have in your life. It is a convenient messaging and event organisation platform, as well as a global, searchable person directory if you meet someone cool at a party and want to get in touch. In theory you can use it to discuss deep and interesting topics with a wide spectrum of people you don’t normally see. And in theory you can use it to see what important but distant people in your life are up to. And in theory you can also use it for serendipity and finding out if someone you used to know and love has moved to the same city as you.

But in practice, the reason we go on Facebook is because it is addictive. It is very deliberately designed to by-pass your conscious mind and <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/how-to-manufacture-desire.html" target="_blank">pull levers deep inside your brain</a>, and it is either going to keep getting better at this or lose out to someone else who goes even further. We can invent all manner of post-hoc rationalisations that imbue us with a deeper sense of agency, but fundamentally these play an entirely secondary role to addiction. Perhaps you don’t mind this, but I feel that in general you probably should. Whenever a multi-multi-billion dollar company is trying to play around inside your head in order to generate profit, it seems sensible to try and stop them.

Some people get off Facebook completely. This is a ballsy move, and it does completely annihilate the problem. But it throws the moderately useful baby out with the murky, faeces-riddled bath water, and makes legitimate contact and organisation noticeably harder. Instead, I would suggest the following 5 steps in order to keep Facebook around, but in its place. The goal is to never go to the website unless you have a specific reason to, and when you do have to make this perilous journey, to get in, do what you have to do, and then get out ASAP.

1. <i>Turn on email notifications</i> - yes, on. But only for direct messages, event invitations and friend requests. Turn off everything else. Filter and archive these notifications into a separate label in Gmail. Now you never have to check Facebook and risk getting waylaid by crap you don’t actually care about, because you already know whether or not there is anything waiting for you. You can even reply to messages from your email client, enabling you to process Facebook messages in the same style (eg. GTD) as you process emails. Now all we have to solve is your crippling email addiction.

2. <i>Bookmark facebook.com/messages</i> - you want to use Facebook almost purely as a secondary message inbox. Landing on the Messages page rather than the Newsfeed makes perfect sense, and a surprisingly large difference just on its own.

3. <i>Hide the Newsfeed</i> - just in case you should still accidentally find yourself in the attention and happiness black hole that is the Facebook.com homepage, make sure that the Newsfeed is safely hidden away and unable to bother you. Download the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en" target="_blank">Stylish plugin for Chrome</a>, and add the following rule to apply only on the domain “facebook.com”. Then look back. The Newsfeed has gone. You’re safe now.

        }
    {% endhighlight %}

4. <i>Don’t save your password</i> - introduce just a little extra friction to the Facebook process to remind yourself that there’s a good chance you don’t want to be doing this.

5. <i>No native apps</i> - native apps send obnoxious dings, make Facebook accessible in places you don’t want it to be and ruin all of the hard work you just put into hamstringing your laptop Facebook experience. Get rid of all your native apps and never look back. Facebook on an iPad browser is only a marginally better experience than on a Nokia 3310, so you should be totally covered.

With these 5 steps, you keep the good and healthy elements of crack cocaine, without the brain-hotwiring, attention-destroying crappy parts. The experience is nothing short of liberating. And that fact is pretty scary in itself.

title: Double standards

Everyone knows that people on benefits prefer to stay on benefits rather than take below living-wage jobs with no prospects or security, and that this is because they are lazy and stupid and all round totally shit.

And everyone also know that rich people and companies are obviously going to respond to higher tax rates by moving all their money out the country, and that this is because they are badass rational actors and savvy businessmen.

So let’s make the benefits system so terrible that even the worst jobs look attractive by comparison.

But let’s keep tax rates low so that no one has to even worry about exploiting the offshore loophole du jour.

Problems solved.

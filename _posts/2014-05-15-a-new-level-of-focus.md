title: A new level of focus

Since I decided to write a blog post everyday, I like to think that my writing has become tighter, more focussed, and much better because of this.

If you were being unfair, you might instead suggest that writing a blog post everyday incentivises phoning it in more and more often, as each post merges generically into the next, borne of intrinsically trite subject matters incapable of supporting more than a handful of rushed paragraphs excreted onto a keyboard in between breakfast and work.

I donâ€™t think that this is true.

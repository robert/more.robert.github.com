title: You might just have got unlucky
---
When something goes wrong, it seems healthy to check whether there was anything you could have reasonably done differently. There are lots of bad things that can happen to you, some have probably even happened to you at some point, and you probably don’t need me to list any examples. Nonetheless, I will. Maybe you lose a big hand of poker, break up with your girlfriend, get ill, have your laptop stolen, lose your sunglasses, fail your exams.

In these cases, introspection is important, but it can also make it hard to ever decide that this time there actually was nothing you should have done differently. Things go wrong some percentage of the time, even when done perfectly. It can sound like self-delusion, but maybe you really were right to call his raise, or she was hung up on her last boyfriend, or you studied as much as a sane human could have.

It probably doesn’t happen all that often, but you might just have got unlucky.

title: I hate the smell of email in the morning
---
Did you know that in any modern day city of decent size that you are never more than 2 metres from an email client? This makes it almost statistically impossible not to check your emails first thing in the morning. Even if your phone is out of battery, your laptop is probably on your desk and you must have put your tablet somewhere. There’s not strictly any need to check right now, but she might have finally sent you a reply, or a long-lost friend from a different time zone might be coming to town, or you might have been nominated for, or even outright awarded a prize of some kind.

It’s clearly not that terrible in itself if you do have a quick peek. You can make somewhat spiritual sounding claims about the morning being an intrinsically special time, or cite studies on how it’s when you’re at your most creative. But even if these are true, you still have life. You can rebuild.

However, to trivialise a genuinely tragic situation by comparing it to my stupid problems, it’s like if a heroin addict wakes up and kicks off the day with a big mug of drugs. It’s probably no worse for his body than if he’d had them after a brisk walk and a nutritious breakfast, but he is making a strong statement about what’s important and how the day is going to continue.

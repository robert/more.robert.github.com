title: What do you want to do today?
---
Free time should be something to be explored. It should be a pulse-quickening, uncharted land of opportunity, full of exotic if metaphorical scenery waiting to be uncovered.

You can instead see free time as something to be navigated. All too often I see a treacherous territory, full of disasters like reading Hacker News too much, watching TV I don’t care about, doing busywork or drowning in Facebook. I focus on negative experiences, and the goal is to avoid them and get to other side.

It seems like it would be much better to focus on positives, to spend your effort on finding out what and where they are, and then doing them. Maximise the maximum, rather than the minimum.

I’m often choosing my activities by thinking “what could I do now?”, coming up with a list of things that seem passably interesting and constructive, and choosing one of them with all due haste before I get lethargic. But, at the weekend, I was walking home and for some reason instead thought “what do I <i>want</i> to do now?” And bizarrely and slightly worryingly, this felt quite alien.

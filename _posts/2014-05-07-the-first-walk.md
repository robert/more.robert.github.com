title: The First Walk
---
The man went for a walk. It was nighttime, or midday. It was drizzling, or sunny. He had just finished a big project at work, or moved house, or been for a long run, or drunk 3 cups in coffee in quick succession, or returned to his childhood home after many years absent. The walk was like no walk he had ever been on. He found deep meaning in thoughts that had seemed tedious the day before. He was a part of a world where he had only ever been a spectator. Colours were deeper, sounds were more colourful, and whilst he didn’t actually talk to anybody, he felt a connection to everyone he passed and he knew that they felt it too.

Several weeks later the man felt quite mediocre. He went for a walk. But it was the wrong kind of nighttime, or a defective type of sunny. He hadn’t done anything of note recently, and the walk was like every walk he had been on before. Tedious thoughts remained tedious, and colours were the same shade of bland that they always were. He felt connected to no one and nothing. He went home.

He could not understand it. He tried again the next day. He read a chapter of Jack Kerouac before he left. He concentrated on his mind. He thought back to his past. He thought forward to his future. He pictured the earth from space and the space from earth. But he felt nothing.

He became obsessed. Every night, or midday, he put on his shoes and tried to recreate the First Walk. He retraced his exact steps. He studied the weather forecasts. He read and re-read the books he had been reading, and wrote and re-wrote the reports he had been writing. He manufactured heart-wrenching fights with his closest friends, and an almost equal number of tearful reunions. But he felt nothing.

On the nth attempt, he spotted a twenty-something middle-class computer programmer from London sitting on a bench, writing on his MacBook Pro and looking moderately happy about some things. Although he did also look perturbed by some other things, and you could tell that many of the things he appeared to be happy about he actually wasn’t entirely confident in. The man ran up to him. “How do you do it?” he asked. “What’s your secret?”

“Experience what is there,” the programmer on a bench said. “Don’t try and recreate the past. Create the present, watch what is happening, and be happy in it.”

And the man understood. He went for a walk.

2 months later, he failed to make the payments on his mortgage and his house was repossessed. He went back to the programmer on a bench, who was way out of his depth and completely unable to help him. The man did not understand anymore. He went for a walk anyway.

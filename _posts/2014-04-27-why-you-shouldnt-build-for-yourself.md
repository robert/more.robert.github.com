title: Why you shouldn't build for yourself
---
"Build for your customers, not for yourself" has become a startup meme in recent years. The standard justification goes that you may happen to have different preferences and priorities to them, and that a sample size of one is never statistically significant. 

But we can explain things much better than that. Post-launch, the single concrete reason why you are definitely different to 99.9% of your potential customers is that you are using your product and they are not. That is it. You persevered through your crappy UI and terrible onboarding flow. You know the difference between a group and a team, have access to the Heroku command line and have taken the time to customise your account to work optimally for you. And your financial future rests on the assumption that you are building something great and so you HAVE to want to use it otherwise what are you doing? 

This is why you want the ability to visualise the mountains of data you have inputted into your account. It's why you want to be able to intelligently filter your messages by breed of dog mentioned in the title. Because you are already sold on your product and it's fundamental usefulness, and have already dragged yourself over the numerous barriers to understanding and being interested in what it has to offer. But the other 99.9% of your potential customers think your product is stupid and have received absolutely no gratification from it whatsoever. They are confused by it and don't know or care how to do anything in it. They don't want the things you want because they fundamentally do not want to use it at all.

Building for yourself is not just a sample size problem - it is completely missing the most important characteristic of your market. Build for people who don't use your product until some of them do.

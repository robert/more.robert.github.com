title: The housemate and the fox urine
---
During the summer I like leaving the garden door open. Ironically, it provides a window into the outside world, into the sunshine, fresh air and child-like glee of the city. Note that my garden backs onto a school, and said glee is provided by actual children, although I should make it clear that they are doing so from outside the confines of my property. However, one of my housemates has repeatedly voiced concerns that a fox will take this opportunity to dart into our kitchen, urinate over all our stuff, and then beat a hasty retreat, its pungent if baffling mission accomplished.

This might happen. I donâ€™t know many foxes personally, but it seems plausible that this is the kind of thing they do for fun. But it seems equally, if not more plausible that it is not. In addition, whilst I have no active desire for my shoes to be filled with liquid fox waste, it seems to me that, modern drying and de-urinification technology being what it is, it would not be the end of the world if they were. Given the non-fatal nature of the consequences, I feel very strongly that it is important that we continue to push the door open until the foxes, or other excrement dispensing mammals, start to push back.

To abruptly and ham-fistedly cram a general moral of this story down your throat, you shouldn't worry about non-fatal problems until they are actually grating up against you. Feel free to work this into a startup or programming related context yourself if you are so inclined, you should know how this works by now.

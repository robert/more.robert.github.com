title: I blame momentum
---
I like to think of myself as an individual, zany, free-spirited kind of person, as do millions of people exactly like me. To my mind, a key part of this image is a keen appreciation of parks, nighttime, and especially parks at nighttime. And yet I often cycle home from places, through parks, at nighttime, and decide that actually it doesn’t make any sense to stop and sit on a bench for a while, for all manner of real but surprisingly hard to articulate reasons. I blame momentum.

I have come to the conclusion that either I’m full of crap, and have no more interest in parks or nighttime than everyone else, or I need a little more imagination.

title: The mechanism of Parkinson's Law

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law" target="_blank">Parkinson’s Law</a> states:

> "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"

Anyone who hasn’t anecdotally experienced its effects is either a robot or hasn’t been paying attention. 2 hour meetings, all-night essays, writing emails, writing reports, even writing code can all be struck down by its unstoppable, ever-expanding tentacles. But it has always felt like a strange law to me. In order for it be quantitatively true there has to be an actual, systematic change in the amount of work you do or the way in which you do it. It didn’t seem plausible that everybody just becomes more lazy in almost exact proportion to how much time they have available. Parkinson’s Law afflicts people who don’t even know the meaning of the word lazy, which sounds like a badass accolade but actually just makes a small subset of their everyday conversations unnecessarily confusing.

But now I think I understand it. I moved house yesterday, and my two housemates and I have spent the last two days cleaning our old place until it shone. Already alarm bells should be going off. 6 person-days is a long, long time, especially to spend on a relatively simple, if intensive task. Blissfully unaware of the dangers awaiting us, I started in my bedroom. I vacuumed, mopped the floor, cleaned the skirting boards. I painted the floor, painted the walls, and generally dusted all the major surfaces. Then I painted the walls again. Then I dusted the underside of the shelves. Then I scrubbed the inside of the wardrobe. Then I cleaned the skirting boards again. Then I realised what was going on.

If we had to finish in an hour, I would not be doing any of these things. I would be pragmatically mopping the downstairs floor, prudently scrubbing the oven and efficiently trimming back the garden. I was inventing  fractally more specific sub-tasks because I felt nervous and unhurried about moving on from my room. It would have felt rushed and feckless to declare the whole house finished a day ahead of schedule and spend the rest of the time playing Pokemon, so any local efficiencies were sure to be swallowed by other trivialities. Work expands to fill its container by destroying your ability to prioritise and by making you feel guilty about finishing early. Do you want to be the person who tries to wrap up the planned 3 hour conference call after 30 minutes?

So I stopped cleaning at 5pm, smugly citing Parkinson’s Law despite being unable to provide any concrete data or convincing proof that it applied here. The others carried on until 9pm, and we finished the next evening, half an hour before the deadline. I claimed this as a vindication of my strategy. My tired and irritable housemates disagreed. I still believe that it was, but it goes to show that whilst awareness of Parkinson’s Law will help you to make better scheduling decisions, it doesn’t mean that you will have any friends.

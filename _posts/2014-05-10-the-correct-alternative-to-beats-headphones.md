title: The correct alternative to Beats headphones
---
It seems that Apple are buying Beats. I’ve never listened through any Beats headphones, but the overwhelming opinion from my 3 friends who have is that they are awful. They are purely a branding play, and anyone you see wearing them is a hopeless fashion victim whose opinion about anything should be immediately ignored.

Instead, I am sitting at my desk, next to my trusty Boses, pitying the fools with all my heart. Yes Bose are also a premium brand that get a lot of attention and purchases because of their name. But everyone knows that this is different, because their headphones are actually good. Aren’t they? You play music through them and it sounds nice, kind of basically how you expected it to sound. If you adjust the volume correctly then it’s not too loud but not too quiet either, and whilst they are made mostly out of plastic, it still feels pretty strong so you aren’t really too worried. But listening through Beats is like listening to a monkey trying valiantly to reproduce a song through the medium of farts. Probably.

But, to simplify, you can (maybe) break the price of any product into the amount you pay for the product and the amount you pay for the brand. So any strong brand that only charges for their products without tacking on a brand surcharge is missing out on a large chunk of money for no reason. Even the brands whose image is that they make high quality stuff will still be charging you for this image, on top of the amount you would pay for a white labelled version of their nonetheless high quality product. So your $500 headphones are still $250 of branding and $250 of product, and you are still a sucker.

The solution is to only ever buy electronics made by <a href='http://www.philips.co.uk/' target="_blank">Philips</a>. Their products are probably great, but as far as I and everyone (everyone) I know is concerned, they are the headphones to listen to Dad-Rock through. Every now and then they make an adorable effort to coat themselves in layers of fluff like all the other kids are doing, but they aren’t fooling anyone, and they never will. So when you buy Philips, you can assume they aren’t trying to get away with charging anything for their brand, so you’re getting all headphones.

Philips - it’s all about the product.

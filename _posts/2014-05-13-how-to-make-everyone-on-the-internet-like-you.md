title: How to make everyone on the internet like you
---
When you’re writing on the internet, almost anyone in the world can read what you post. In theory. In practice, things tend to work out rather differently, but you still don’t know who is going to see your words. Someone who doesn’t know how cool you are in real life might read some of your work and conclude that you are a top arsehole. You can qualify and moderate and prevaricate as much as you want, but someone will always find some reason to decide you are a douchebag. This is, of course, an incredibly pressing problem, as it is vital that everyone on the internet has a high opinion of you.

I believe I have identified a very strong weapon in this fight. Let’s say you notice yourself potentially coming off as obnoxious, or obsequious, or oblivious, or just really, really, staggeringly racist. You should state outright that you are in fact not behaving in this way, and then acknowledge that it might look like you are by describing back that very same manner. For example:

> “I don’t feel proud of this, but it is something that I feel good and congratulate myself about.”

Or:

> “This isn’t a prima donna attitude, it’s just making sure that my skills get properly noticed.”

Or:

> “I don’t think I’m better than everyone else because of this, but it does make me calmer, more pleasant to be with, more attractive, better at cooking and a more skilful lover.”

You show both self-awareness AND a willingness to stand up for yourself in the face of opposition, whilst arguably having neither. This isn’t being disingenuous, it’s just knowingly obfuscating the truth.

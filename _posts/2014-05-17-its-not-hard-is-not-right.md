title: "It's not hard" is not right
---
I was talking to a young human male with the beginnings of an interest in programming this morning. “Man, programming looks so complicated” he said. Deciding that it was time to be magnanimous and inspirational, I replied, “It’s really not that hard.” “Yeah, but probably nothing’s hard for people like you,” he said morosely. Clearly he had not heard about the number of times I failed my driving test, and I had not had the motivational impact I had hoped.

But what I said was basically true. Lots of people can programme. Lots of people are good at it. It doesn’t take a genius to work out what `if price > 50` means, and everything else is just so many layers above or below that.

What I should have said was “it’s really very doable.” It’s not hard, and it’s not easy either, but it just takes N hours of directed effort. If you invest said N hours in an intelligent way, you will be a total beast. This is ‘hard’ in some sense, but not in the out-of-my-galaxy way that he meant.

Hopefully I’ll see him again, and hopefully he’ll still care.

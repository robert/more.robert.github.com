I went to meditate at a local temple for the first time in 3 years yesterday. Over the years when I used to go regularly, there was one family who were present at every session I ever went to. I assume their relationship was mother, father and daughter, but I don’t know. They always sat in the same places, in a row by the far wall. There was nothing special about these spots other than history, and they were always left free for them. The father often seemed unwell. He would have frequent coughing and sneezing fits during practise, a time when 20 other people were setting aside the concerns and travails of the rest of their lives in order to be still and silent. I liked to think I felt equanimous in the face of disturbances. Sometimes I did. Other times I was tired, or moody, or stressed, and I did not.

Couldn’t he see how distracting this must have been?

Yesterday, after 3 years on top of what must have been decades, the mother and daughter were there, in their old places, in a row by the far wall. They stood, and walked, and sat, and chanted. The father was not there.
